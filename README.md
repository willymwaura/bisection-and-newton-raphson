# Bisection and Newton-Raphson

## Bisection Method

This method involves dividing the interval containing the root into subintervals and determining which subinterval the root is in.In my case, the function was:

$$x^4 - x^3 -10$$

The tolerance was given as $ 1e -6$ while the maximum iteration was 100.The code was to calculate how many times it took to get to the root.And in this case, this was found to be 11.

The code was also to be timed and the execution time determined,hence the use of the use of the timeit function.The total execution time was found to be 0.00043 seconds.
The root was found at:
$$x=2.092090$$

### Python code

```
import timeit

a=2
b=3
tolerance =1e-6
max_iterations =100
count=0

def sol(x):
    return x**4 - x**3 -10


def bisection():
    # access the variables outside the function
    global a,b, count

    for i in range(max_iterations): 
        c=(a+b)/2
        count +=1
        if abs(sol(c)) < tolerance:
            print(f"Root found at x = {c:.6f}")
            break
        elif sol(c)*sol(a)<0 :
            b=c
        else:
            a=c


# measure the execution time of bisection
execution_time = timeit.timeit(bisection, number=1)

# Print the execution time
print(f"Execution time: {execution_time:.5f} seconds")

#print count/no of iterations
print(f"count is: {count} in total")
```

### Results

```
Root found at x = 2.092090
Execution time: 0.00015 seconds
count is: 23 in total
```

## Newton-Raphson Method

This method is used to find the roots of differentiable functions.Uses idea of tangent line.The function in question is:
$$x^4-x^3-10$$
On differentiating,the function will be
$$4x^3-3x^2$$

The tolerance in the question is $1e-6$
maximum iteration is $100$ while the initial count is set to $0$. We are supposed to determine how many times it will take to get to the root and that's why we use count.

### Python Code

```
import timeit

x0=1
tolerance=1e-6
max_iteration = 100
count =0

# Define the function
def func(x):
    return x**4 - x**3 -10


# Define the function's derivative
def der(x):
    return 4*x**3 - 3*x**2


# Define the Newton-Raphson method
def newton_raphson():
    global x0, count,tolerance,max_iteration
    for i in range (max_iteration):
        x1 =x0 -func(x0)/der(x0)
        count+=1
        if abs (func(x1)) < tolerance:
            print(f"Root found at x = {x1:.6f}")
            break
        else:
            x0 = x1


# Measure the execution time of newton_raphson
execution_time = timeit.timeit(newton_raphson, number=1)

# Print the execution time
print(f"Execution time: {execution_time:.5f} seconds")

print(f"count is: {count} in total")

```

### results

```
Root found at x =2.092090
Execution time: 0.00034 seconds
count is: 11 in total
```
